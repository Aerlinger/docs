In this tutorial, you'll learn how to use data binding and expressions to build awesome, interactive AMP pages with [`<amp-bind>`](/docs/reference/components/amp-bind.html).

## What you'll build

You'll build an e-commerce product page that:

- Uses AMP HTML and AMP components for a fast and rich user experience.
- Includes cross-element interactivity by using [`<amp-bind>`](/docs/reference/components/amp-bind.html).
- Fetches additional product data on demand by using [`<amp-state>`](/docs/reference/components/amp-bind.html#state).
